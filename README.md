## üëã Welcome! 
Welcome to this "Autogen" GitHub repository! AutoGen is a powerful framework designed to empower the development of Large Language Model (LLM) applications that thrive on collaboration between multiple agents. These agents are not only customizable and conversable but also seamlessly integrate human participation into the process. With AutoGen, you can create applications that can tackle a wide range of tasks by combining the strengths of LLMs, human inputs, and specialized tools.
